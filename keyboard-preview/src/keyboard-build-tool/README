Automated build tool for the kasahorow keyboard preview source files.

=== Requirements ===
Install of Go for windows (http://golang.org/), Git (if we need to download deps during the build process). 
Both tools should exist in PATH.

=== Instructions ===
Take a look at the config.json file (only valid json is acceptable) and edit it accordingly. Each configuration
should be present as a separate json object. Each object has the following porperties:

	"langHuReadable" - Keyboard layout name in human readable form. This will be used to locate the windows keyboard layout ID from the registry. 
					   If in doubt, look up the language name in the control panel (language needs to be present on the system first).
	"langString" - Language string used in various labels inside the program (e.g. "Switch to Akan.")
	"infoText" - Info text visible to the user (e.g. "The layout was successfully installed. Try typing something!")

After setting up the config file, open up the console and set the GOPATH environment variable first. For example, if source files are 
located in "keyboard-preview>src>keyboard-build-tool", set GOPATH like "set GOPATH=C:\keyboard-preview". Once GOPATH is set navigate to the keyboard-build-tool folder and run it. E.g.

cd C:\keyboard-preview\src\keyboard-build-tool 
keyboard-build-tool.exe

The tool will generate binary files and export them to "keyboard-preivew\bin\win-386\keyboard-bin\".
