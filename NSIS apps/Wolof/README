keyboardapp.nsi generates an executable that combines Wolof.exe and Wolof-app into keyboard-wolof.exe

Upon installing keyboard-wolof.exe, langString is written to "Software\kasahorow\KWriter\wol". The langID (new variable introduced into config.json) in this case is "wol"

The langID will not change as they are standard ISO codes. This design change is important so that the langString and/or langHuReadable can be changed at will.
